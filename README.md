# Single-cell Translation Efficiency Resource

> This repository includes the code for running the analyses presented in ***Cell type-specific analysis by single-cell profiling identifies a stable mammalian tRNA-mRNA interface and increased translation efficiency in neurons***.
> Please download the zip file into a suitable directory and run Rstudio on the files adult_mouse_full_analysis.Rmd and fetal_human_full_analysis.Rmd. 
> The processed_data subdirectory, which contains the already processed data from the scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq atlases, should be kept in the same directory as these .Rmd files.
