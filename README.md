# sc_tRNA_mRNA

This repository includes the code for running the analyses presented in "Analysis at single-cell resolution identifies a stable mammalian tRNA-mRNA interface and increased translation efficiency in neurons." Please download the zip file into a suitable directory and run Rstudio on the files adult_mouse_full_analysis.Rmd and fetal_human_full_analysis.Rmd. The processed_data subdirectory, which contains the already processed data from the scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq atlases, should be kept in the same directory as these .Rmd files.
